LO1: The student plans and executes a project in their track at level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity, in an agile way.

In my own words: The student should be able to take an active part in a group project regarding their chosen track (project 4 embedded systems). They are meant to do this at the 2nd level of the HBO-i framework. This means that they are supposed to be able to do this project mostly individually/with their group, while still having some guidance of teachers. The student has to do this in an agile way by making use of the agile scrum method with the use of a scrum board, scrum meetings, etc.

How I will reach this goal: I will take an active role in this project by working together with my teammate. By making use of different tools like Github, Whatsapp and Teams we will easily be able to communicate with one another aswell as work on the project at the same time. I will also do a lot of individual work this project by coding from home/taking our components home and working from there. Each week we will start by having a quick scrum meeting, explaining what we have done last week and what we are going to do this week.

LO2: The student demonstrates professional skills at level 2 in the focus areas: future-oriented organization, investigative ability, personal leadership, and targeted interaction.

In my own words: The student should be able to show that they are professional with their work and communication. For this project the main focus of these professional skills are aimed towards the following four catagories: future-oriented organization, investigative ability, personal leadership, and targeted interaction. Future-oriented organization means that the student should be adaptable and should be able to think ahead into the future. Investigative ability means that the student should be able to research problems they run into during the project and think of ideas how to deal with these problems. Personal leadership means that the student should be able to make their own decisions and show their own initiative. Personal development is also important in this part. Lastly there is targeted interaction which in terms of this project means the communication with the stakeholders/teachers.

How I will reach this goal: I will be able to show my proffesionalism by having decent-looking work and by having proper communication with my group member/project coaches. This project will also test my abilities of being able to adapt to problems I come across and look ahead for any problems I might run into. I will be able to solve these problems on my on or together with my teammate. I should also be able to investigate these problems and conclude why they are occuring. I also need to work on my personal leadership this project. I can do this by setting certain goals for myself each week and communicating these goals with my teammate. Lastly I will also need to work on my targeted interaction (communication with the stakeholders/teachers). This will mostly be done in person by talking to the teachers directly, but this also includes emails and messages.
